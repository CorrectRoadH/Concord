## Entity Ownership

Define which entities contain or reference each other, how they are identified, and which owner creates and destroys them. Give exact shapes for public configuration and results.

## Data Flow

Trace input to output through each responsible module and name every intermediate product that crosses an ownership boundary.

Use Mermaid for relationships and flows. When motion or adjustable parameters explain the model better, add a `p5` fence and a prose explanation. External sketch and CSS paths are relative to this Markdown page; extension libraries belong in project `p5.libraries`. See `concord --skill view` for complete examples.

## Invariants

List the properties every implementation must preserve.

## Errors

Assign each failure to its stage and owner, and define the observable terminal result.

## Identity and Reuse

State which declarations and results contribute to identity, when reuse is valid, and what invalidates it.
