# {{title}}

Describe how this feature is implemented. Behavior belongs in the README, Use Case, cli, library, api, format, ui, and performance pages; refactors that keep behavior change only this page. When the internal storage needs its own page, write it in `data-model.md` and link it here.

## Modules and Ownership

Name each module, its responsibility, and which owner creates and destroys each entity.

## Data Flow

Trace input to output through each responsible module and name every intermediate product that crosses an ownership boundary.

Use Mermaid for relationships and flows. When motion or adjustable parameters explain the model better, add a `p5` fence and a prose explanation. External sketch and CSS paths are relative to this Markdown page; extension libraries belong in project `p5.libraries`. See `concord --skill view` for complete examples.

## Invariants

List the properties every implementation must preserve.

When state or ownership changes matter, name legal transitions, forbidden states, and atomic actions. Link observable guarantees to their behavior pages.

Use formal verification when the risk and hard-to-reach cases justify it. State the property, assumptions, exploration bounds, and omissions; eventual completion also needs scheduling and fairness assumptions. For high-risk guarantees, name faults the verification must detect.

A model pass does not prove implementation correctness: implementation work must check model-to-code correspondence and real behavior separately. Keep executable verification and its relations in their own sources, not a second feature map or sync history here.

## Resource Lifecycle

When the feature holds resources or state, describe how each owner acquires and validates them. Then describe how it runs, reuses and revalidates them. Describe cleanup after normal and interrupted runs. State what invalidates reuse and the observable result of cleanup failure.

## Failure Stages

Assign each failure to its stage and owner: acquisition, execution, cancellation or cleanup. Link the observable error to the behavior page that defines it, and do not let one failure hide another.

## Key Choices and Dependencies

Record the choices this implementation depends on, including third-party libraries and internal inter-process communication.
