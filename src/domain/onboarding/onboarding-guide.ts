export const onboardingGuide = `# Developing with Concord

Follow this project's AGENTS.md and keep the Spec current before changing behavior. Read the guides from the installed Concord version; this page is an entrypoint, not a copy of their workflows.

## Start writing

Run \`concord --skill start\` with the current request and repository context. Reuse an already stated goal; ask only when a missing decision affects the work.

Run \`concord --skill document\` for the document model, a docs tree and complete linked examples. Write through the main user's actual interface, choose only the pages needed, and review the prose before adding implementation relations.

## Choose the task

| Task | Guide |
| --- | --- |
| Discover guides | \`concord --skill\` |
| Set up or configure this repository | \`concord --skill init\` |
| Write or revise Spec | \`concord --skill spec\` |
| Implement an agreed Spec | \`concord --skill implement\` |
| Review changes against Spec | \`concord --skill review\` |
| Fix a defect | \`concord --skill fix\` |
| Work with Issue or reusable Memory | \`concord --skill feedback\` or \`concord --skill memory\` |

Use each command's \`--help\` for its current parameters. Keep changes within the task's scope and existing authorization. Run \`concord check\` after editing; distinguish introduced findings, necessary dependencies and other existing problems.

## Project documents

Start at [the project docs](README.md), [architecture](architecture.md) and [taste](taste.md). Use \`concord list\` and \`concord show\` to discover current documents and their relations. Examples in guides illustrate writing; replace them with this project's own requirements.
